Insu Choi*(KAIST); Jaepil Choi*(Woori Bank); Woohyuk Choi*(POSTECH); Woochang Kim(KAIST) (2023). An ensemble investment strategy based on Prophet and XGBoost regression estimation. A collection of papers from the Fall Conference of the Korean Society for Industrial Management and Systems, 2023.

This research delves into developing and evaluating a novel algorithm tailored for generating optimized portfolios
comprising 200 long and 200 short positions from a universe of 2,000 items, based predominantly on Machine Learning
(ML) techniques.

• Recognizing the heterogeneity and complexity of financial markets, our approach uniquely integrates three distinct views
and investment strategies. Instead of relying on a singular predictive model, we harness the consensus power of hard
voting, a method traditionally used in ensemble learning.

• Through this fusion, our algorithm enhances prediction accuracy and ensures diversification and robustness, key
hallmarks of a resilient portfolio. Extensive back-testing and validation on historical data demonstrate promising
outperformance compared to traditional portfolio construction methods.
